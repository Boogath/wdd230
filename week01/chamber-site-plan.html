    <p>Site Name</p>
    <div class="sub-section">
        <p>This is the name of the site normally based upon the locale and purpose. 
            A representative domain that is available to purchase would be normally important but 
            not required in this class. Provide a valid site name that is relevant to the locale. 
            Include the word "Chamber" in the site name and a short reason why the the site name was selected.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Site Purpose</p>
    <div class="sub-section">
        <p>The site purpose should attempt to provide scope to the website content in describing 
            what services and information will be provided. The client typically drives this content 
            by stating functional specifications. It is OK to be less formal than this given example. 
            Provide at least two purposes for having the website developed and running.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Scenarios</p>
    <div class="sub-section">
        <p>Scenarios are questions that are asked by a site visitor who represents the target audience 
            of the organization or company. The questions will drive the content of the website as it 
            provides answers to the questions. Again, much of the content specifications will actually 
            be provided but start thinking about the target audience of a chamber of commerce site. 
            Visit real chamber of commerce sites. Include at least three scenarios.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Color Schema</p>
    <div class="sub-section">
        <p>The color schema refers to the carefully selected site colors that reflect the organization's 
            purpose and trademark. The planning document defines the color scheme through a color palette 
            that labels color style definitions and swatches for site elements. Define at least two colors 
            and show where each color selected will be used, such as headings, paragraphs, background colors, 
            accents, and so on.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Typography</p>
    <div class="sub-section">
        <p>The typography section of the planning document provides examples of the fonts to be used and 
            where they are to be applied. No less than one font and no more than three fonts selections 
            need to be selected. Indicate where each selected font will be used (such as headings, body, 
            and so on). Other fonts can be used for special circumstances or sections as needed.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Wireframe</p>
    <div class="sub-section">
        <p>Provide a rough sketch of the design of the chamber home page layout. 
            Wireframe diagrams can be simple and do not need to have actual content, 
            just representations of content and their layout relationship. Provide a 
            sketch for the mobile view and for an larger, such as desktop, view for the home page.</p>
